## Short answer: you *can* export H.264/MP4 from JavaScript in real time, but the best path depends on your target browsers and how much control/quality you need.

### Practical options (from most real-time friendly to most controllable)
1. **MediaRecorder + canvas.captureStream() (or any MediaStream)**

⠀
* What it is: the built-in, hardware-accelerated recorder. Ideal when you just want “record what I’m animating right now” with minimal code.
* H.264/MP4 support in 2025:
  * Chromium/Edge now expose **MP4 muxing and H.264/HEVC** in MediaRecorder on platforms that have the codecs (feature-gated & device/OS-dependent).   
  * Safari has long recorded to **video/mp4** (fragmented MP4) on iOS/macOS. **Support varies and has quirks**, so you must feature-detect.   
  * Firefox support for H.264/MP4 via MediaRecorder is still inconsistent; prefer WebM there or fall back.   
* How to use (sketch):

⠀
const stream = canvas.captureStream(60); // or element.captureStream()
const types = [
  'video/mp4;codecs="avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2"', // try MP4/H.264 + AAC
  'video/webm;codecs="h264"',                 // Chromium often supports this
  'video/webm;codecs=vp9',
  'video/webm;codecs=vp8',
];
const type = types.find(t => MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported(t));
const rec = new MediaRecorder(stream, { mimeType: type, videoBitsPerSecond: 16_000_000 });
// collect dataavailable blobs → make a File/URL

Use high videoBitsPerSecond for quality; actual encoder settings remain platform-driven.  

2. **WebCodecs + MP4 muxer (for precise control & quality)**

⠀
* What it is: you push your frames to VideoEncoder (H.264), then **mux** the encoded chunks into MP4 with libraries like **mp4box.js** or **mp4-muxer**. This gives you frame-exact control, CFR/VFR, keyframe cadence, bitrates, etc. Works in workers and can be real-time on machines with hardware encoders.   
* Helpful libraries/examples:
  * **mp4box.js** (GPAC) for MP4 muxing.  
  * **mp4-muxer** (vanilagy) minimal MP4 muxer used with WebCodecs.  
  * **CrafyVideoJS**: a wrapper combining WebCodecs VideoEncoder/VideoDecoder with mp4box.js to encode/decode H.264 MP4 fully in-browser.  
* Caveat: you still depend on platform decode/encode capabilities for H.264 profiles/levels and performance. Use feature detection and adjust config (avc.format: "annexb" vs AVCC) as needed.  

⠀
3. **FFmpeg compiled to WebAssembly (ffmpeg.wasm)**

⠀
* What it is: a pure-JS/WASM encoder (x264 or similar) that works everywhere the CPU is fast enough.
* Pros: consistent outputs, tons of flags/filters.
* Cons: **rarely real-time at 1080p+** in the browser; heavy downloads; CPU-bound. Great as a fallback or for post-processing, not ideal for live recording.   

⠀
4. **Frame capture + offline encode (CCapture.js + FFmpeg)**

⠀
* What it is: grab lossless PNGs/RAW frames during your animation, then encode to MP4 afterwards (locally with ffmpeg/ffmpeg.wasm or on a server). Produces the **highest quality**, perfect-frame outputs, but **not** real-time.   

⠀
### What I’d recommend depending on your constraints
* **You want simple, real-time “record my animation now”**:

⠀Use MediaRecorder + canvas.captureStream() with **feature detection** for H.264/MP4; fall back to WebM VP9/VP8 when needed. This gets you hardware encoding and good file sizes with minimal code.   
* **You need finer control over bitrate, GOP, timestamps, CFR/VFR, and consistent MP4 output** (and can spend a bit more engineering time):

⠀Use **WebCodecs (H.264) + mp4box.js/mp4-muxer**. It can be real-time on modern hardware and gives you deterministic results.  
* **You need deterministic quality everywhere, including slower/older machines, and real-time isn’t mandatory**:

⠀Capture frames and encode after the fact (CCapture.js → FFmpeg).  

### Important compatibility/quality notes
* **H.264 MP4 via MediaRecorder is not guaranteed on every browser/OS**. Always probe with MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported() and keep a WebM fallback. Expect different behavior on Firefox and open-source Chromium builds (proprietary codecs).   
* **Safari’s MP4 is often “fragmented MP4”** (fMP4). Many players handle it; some pipelines (e.g., certain AWS services) need remuxing.  
* **Real-time 4K or very high bitrates**: only practical with hardware encoding (MediaRecorder or WebCodecs using platform encoders). WebAssembly encoders generally won’t keep up.

If you tell me your exact target browsers/devices and desired resolution/bitrate (e.g., “1080p60 at ~20–30 Mbps”), I’ll sketch a minimal starter for both the **MediaRecorder** route and the **WebCodecs+mp4box** route tuned to your case.
